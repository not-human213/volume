# Volume Adjustment Project ðŸŽµ  

This repository contains my **Volume Adjustment** project, developed as part of **CS50 Week 4 Assignment**. This program modifies the volume of audio files in the `.wav` format by scaling their sample values.  

## Features âœ¨  

- **Volume Adjustment:** Increase or decrease the volume of `.wav` audio files by a user-defined factor.  
- **Header Preservation:** Maintains the integrity of the `.wav` file header.  
- **Efficient Processing:** Processes audio samples iteratively for minimal memory usage.  

## Tools & Technologies ðŸ›   

- **Language:** C  
- **Input/Output Format:** `.wav` files  

## Getting Started ðŸš€  

### Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following installed:  

- GCC or any C compiler  
- Make utility  

### Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/username/volume-adjustment.git  
   cd volume-adjustment  
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./volume input.wav output.wav factor  

- Replace input.wav with the name of the input audio file.
- Replace output.wav with the desired name of the output audio file.
- Replace factor with a float value to scale the volume (e.g., 2.0 to double, 0.5 to halve).
